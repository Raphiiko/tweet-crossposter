# Tweet Crossposter

This is a service I use to automatically crosspost/sync my tweets to Mastodon and Bluesky.
It's pretty much only written for my own personal use: Expect it to be hacked together spaghetti that you likely can't configure to match your own use case.

## How to run:

1. Rename `docker-compose.yml.template` to `docker-compose.yml`
2. Fill in the missing environment variables in that same file
3. Run it with `docker-compose up -d`
